# Can They Enter (In Java)

This is a simple implementation of a web server, for me to practice some web development.
My first goal is to implement a simple login system with session management.

Features implemented/ to be implemented for the login system:

- [x] Server routing: done using spark java;
- [x] Password hashing: done using bcrypt;
- [x] Database storing and querying: done using jooq (for postgresql) or a simple hashmap for easy
  setup;
- [x] Json processing: done using jackson;
- [x] REST request processing and handling: done using spark java and all the other features
  previously mentioned;
- [ ] Redis Integration;
- [ ] Session Management;
- [ ] Cookie Handling;
